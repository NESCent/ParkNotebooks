These are the scripts used in the Park Notebooks digitization project.

* copyGoogleDocs.py: python script used to create new Google Spreadsheets from a template via the Python API for Google Docs. 
* exportGoogleDocs.py: python script used to download the final spreadsheets to local csv files. Currently has hard-coded paths for download. Should take these as command-line args of from config file. 
* checkData.pl: perl script (this would be python if I knew more about string parsing in python) used to validate the csv files based on columns that we know to be sums of other columns
